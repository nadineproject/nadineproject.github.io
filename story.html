      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <h2>Coworking since 2007</h2>
      <p>
        Nadine is an open source software project designed and built for use at
        Office Nomads to help handle daily operations of the space from both the
        staff and member sides of the house. Nadine has been in continuous use
        and development since 2007.  We are working hard to make Nadine easier
        to install, configure, deploy, and update.

  <h1>OUR VALUES</h1>
  <h2>Encouraging personal connections</h2>
  <p>Nadine supports the philosophy of intentional coworking and supporting consistent human to human interaction:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>We believe in coworking without a filter. Our community is strong when it is diverse.</li>
  <li>Great relationships are not rushed, but are encouraged to grow over time.</li>
  <li>Collaboration will always be stronger than competition.</li>
  <li>We do not create community, we create a strong platform on which community grows.</li>
  <li>We adhere to the coworking core values: collaboration, openness, accessibility, sustainability &amp; community.</li>
  <li>The inherent good nature of people is more powerful than the perceived fears we may hold about strangers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are a number of ways these values are expressed in the design of Nadine.
     For example, Nadine reminds the staff to take new member pictures for the photo
     wall rather than directly nagging the member.  Although it could be more “efficient”
     to have members provide their own photo, photos taken by the staff are large,
     clear, and in focus. This gives the staff another opportunity to connect and
     break the ice with the new member. </p>

      <h2>SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED*</h2>
      <h3>*Django developer recommended</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>We have released Nadine as an open source project meaning it’s “free”,
         but be advised this is more like getting a free puppy.  You need to
         understand what you are getting yourself into.  She will grow up to be
         your best friend but needs a consistent gentle guiding hand. Ideally,
         you are a Django developer, are interested in learning, or have a close
         associate who is.</p>
      <p>Office Nomads is also looking for development partners and we would love
        your help if this interests you. If you are looking for an off the shelf, hosted solution, we suggest
        looking at Cobot, Nexodus, Proximity,
        or one of the other excellent commercial and fully supported coworking software packages.</p>
