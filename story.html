			<h1>History</h1>
			<h2>Coworking Since 2007</h2>
			<p>Nadine is an open source software project designed and built for use at Office Nomads to help handle daily operations of the space from both the staff and member sides of the house. Nadine has been in continuous use and development since 2007.  We are working hard to make Nadine easier to install, configure, deploy, and update.</p>

			<h1>SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED*</h1>
			<h2>*Django developer recommended</h2>
			<p>We have released Nadine as an open source project meaning it’s “free” but be advised this is more like getting a free puppy.  You need to understand what you are getting yourself into.  She will grow up to be your best friend but needs a consistent gentle guiding hand.   Ideally, you are a Django developer, are interested in learning, or have a close associate who is.</p>
			<p>Office Nomads is also looking for development partners to collaborate with going forward so we would love your help if this interests you. If you are looking for an off the shelf, hosted solution, we suggest looking at Cobot, Nexodus, or one of the other excellent commercial and fully supported coworking software packages.</p>

			<h1>VALUES</h1>
			<h2>Encouraging personal connections</h2>
			<p>Nadine supports the philosophy of intentional coworking and supporting consistent human to human interaction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We believe in coworking without a filter. Our community is strong when it is diverse.</li>
				<li>Great relationships are not rushed, but are encouraged to grow over time.</li>
				<li>Collaboration will always be stronger than competition.</li>
				<li>We do not create community, we create a strong platform on which community grows.</li>
				<li>We adhere to the coworking core values: collaboration, openness, accessibility, sustainability &amp; community.</li>
				<li>The inherent good nature of people is more powerful than the perceived fears we may hold about strangers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are a number of ways these values are expressed in the design decisions we have made building out Nadine.  For example, Nadine reminds the staff to take new member pictures for the photo wall rather than directly nagging the member.  Although it could be more “efficient” to have members provide their own photo, it’s more beneficial in the long run to have the staff do it as part of the onboarding process. Photos taken by the staff are large, clear, and in focus; match the rest of the member photos; and it gives the staff another opportunity to connect and break the ice with the new member. </p>
